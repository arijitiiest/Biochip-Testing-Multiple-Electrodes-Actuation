# Efficient Fault Detection and Diagnosis of DigitalMicrofluidic Biochip Using Multiple ElectrodesActuation

### Abstract
Nowadays, Digital Microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is apromising platform where we can concurrently execute complexbioassay  operations.  This  automated,  integrated  chip  is  usedin  Many  safety-critical  applications  like  air-quality  monitoring,point-of-care health assessment, automated drug discovery,  par-allel  DNA  analysis  and  this  is  possible  only  by  deploying  arobust  testing  mechanism.  Some  of  the  earlier  reported  testingand diagnosis algorithms are mostly concentrated on single faultlocalization  or  take  a  significant  amount  of  time  for  multiplefaults   detection.   Even   in   some   cases,   a   non-faulty   electrodeincorrectly classified as a faulty electrode. Thus in this work, wehave proposed a multiple electrodes actuation method for correctlocalization  of  the  defective  electrode(s)  within  very  less  time.Moreover,  when  some  other  bioassay  operations  are  running  ina biochip then also our proposed method can diagnose the faultsof  the  biochip.
